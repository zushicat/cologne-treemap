# cologne-trees-REST-API
An API to request information about city trees in Cologne, Germany.


### Work in progress    
This is a (not quite complete) dynamic version of this static JSON API:    
https://zushicat.github.io/cologne-trees-static-API/     

For actual data usage the static version might be way better suited.    

If you are interested in the underlying data, please refer to:    
https://github.com/zushicat/cologne-trees-data    


For running the API, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/zushicat/cologne-trees-REST-API/tree/master/cologne-treemap-api) in /cologne-treemap-api.



Based on the csv datasets "Baumkataster", published by Stadt KÃ¶ln (versions of 2017 and 2020):
